This is a simple web application where you can enter an amount in Thai Baht and convert it to a currency of your choice. Just input the amount, select your desired currency from the dropdown, and the conversion result will be displayed at the bottom.

This project has been an exciting journey into the world of APIs for me, teaching me how to fetch and process data from an external source to use in my applications. I hope you find it useful and enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it.
